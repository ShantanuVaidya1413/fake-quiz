# Spot-the-Fake Quiz - README

## Description
Spot-the-Fake is a dynamic web-based game where players are challenged to identify counterfeit websites among two images of the same brand. Each pair of images consists of one genuine website and one fake one. Players have 15 seconds per image pair to make their selection. The game comprises a total of 10 questions, and players are provided feedback after each selection.

The game also offers a 'Retry' button to restart and shuffles the order of image pairs for each game session.

### Additional Features
